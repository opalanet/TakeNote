## Getting Started

TakeNote is a static app — there is no build step.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Serve the `public/` folder over local HTTP server
3. Open the URL in your browser

That's it. Notes are stored in your browser's `localStorage` and persist across sessions.

> **Note:** `index.html` loads `js/main.js` as an ES module, so opening the file directly via `file://` will be blocked by the browser CORS policy for modules in some browsers

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl / ⌘` + `N` | Create a new note |
| `Ctrl / ⌘` + `P` | Toggle split preview |
| `Ctrl / ⌘` + `F` | Focus search |
| `Tab` (in editor) | Insert 2-space indent |
| `Escape` | Close search / close mobile sidebar |

## Import & Export

**Export** — Click **Export** in the sidebar footer to download a `takenote-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json` file containing all your notes.

**Import** — Click **Import** and select a previously exported JSON file. Notes with duplicate IDs are skipped automatically; a toast confirms how many were imported and how many were skipped.
